## Enabling off-chain compute

"Actively Verified Services" (AVSs) are a cutting-edge blockchain technology which utilizes "re-staking" to power new types of applications.

The primarily bottleneck for blockchain adoption is the lack of use-cases; AVSs provide a potential path to actual mainstream adoption, by allowing users to interact with truly decentralized applications (via the re-staking protocol).

However, the core problem they currently face is that *building* an AVS is extraordinarily difficult. Although protocols allow, AVS builders must write extremely complex code, and manage complex coordination between operators (who run + validate the actual software computation).

This is where Layer comes in—founded by Jake Hartnell (CEO), Ethan Frey (CTO), and Sam Cassatt (CBO), Layer is building WAVS—a WASM-powered framework for building AVSs. Funded by a16z and backed by the leading technology in the space, Eigenlayer (led by Sreeram Kannan, an affiliate professor at the University of Washington), WAVS makes it extremely easy to build AVSs in as little as 400 lines of code. Because it uses WebAssembly (WASM) code, it is extremely performant and can run anywhere, which makes it far easier to coordinate updates with operators.

## Early product exploration

I was the first hire to Layer's product team (pre-seed), and was responsible for early product exploration. Because WAVS is such a powerful technology, early product exploration
