For capstone, our class was assigned to read an excerpt of Cal Newport’s Deep Work, and reflect on how we could achieve it this quarter.

I’ve scattered these as a collection of bullet points, themes and things I’ve noticed for myself which I want to prioritize going forward. The biggest theme is listening to my body.

## 1. I need downtime

I’ve often seen people argue the necessity of working long hours to get stuff done — and, the fact of the matter is that I have *a lot* to get done, this quarter. But, I know myself, and I know my body — when I’ve reached that point in the day where my brain is fried — I can’t do any more.

Trying to force it does no good, I’m not superhuman (at all). It’s much more sustainable to let myself decompress, to let myself miss (certain) deadlines, and heal up for a new day.

## 2. I need an office; a space that feels like my own

Last quarter, I established a routine of spending Mon–Wed in Seattle at my partner’s place, and Thurs–Sun in Bellevue at my place.

A big thing I noticed: I didn’t really have a comfortable place to get deep work done. I tried different working at different buildings on campus, like Founders, Paccar, Allen, and the HUB — but I always felt this nugget of anxiety in the back of my brain. Even though it was easier to resist distractions (i.e. web browsing) while out-and-about, working at these locations was *taxing*.

On the flipside, working in spaces that feel like “mine” feels much more sustainable. It’s hard to put the *why* into words… But I do know that for a space to feel like “mine”, (A) it needs to have some sense of permanence, and (B) that I have some sort of impact on it.

## 3. Rituals work better than routines

Particularly because of the inconsistency of an academic schedule, I can’t just set hours for myself. Things come up, priorities always change.

But I can do rituals!

One of the biggest productivity breakthroughs I’ve had was using a pomodoro timer (in the form of [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0nyiCIP5ZNZF2vkrhr1cvw?si=3516a2a9448f43ab)), where I established “rules” for focus-time and break-time. In focus-time, all distractions are rejected. In break-time, only certain types of distractions are allowed — slack, reviewing tickets, walking around are all allowed; opening social media is not. Eventually, I realized that the break-time intervals were too disruptive, and settled on using the same ruleset but without a timer.

I haven’t used this system in a while — I think it’s time I bring it back. Also, another really impactful ritual I want to start using again is cleaning up my workspace before starting a session, *especially* when it takes a while to clean up. A messy workspace adds a ton of subconscious distraction, and the act of cleaning is a good form of mental prep/context-switching.

## 4. In bed by 12

I can always tell I’m doing better (in general) when I have a good circadium rhythm going. The best feeling in the world is waking up naturally at 8am, feeling refreshed and ready for the day. When I’ve got this going on, it always seems easier to find that flow state.

The problem is, one late night can disrupt the whole thing — and I’m very prone to “just one more turn.” (Or, in other words, scrolling endlessly for hours.)

Making the conscious decision to be in bed by 12 seems to work very well for me. The important thing here is that I’m not *scheduling* a time to sleep. I’m not telling myself to “be in bed at 11:30”, I’m instead priming myself to look for opportunities to go to bed around that time. It lessens the weight of expectation, which means making that decision uses much less willpower.

## 5. Run!

Last weekend I did a 5k for the first time in a long time, and I felt soooo good for the rest of the day. I know that I can’t use willpower to build a consistent running routine. Defining certain days doesn’t seem to work very well for me either.

But, similar to the “in bed by 12” trick, establishing a system where I’m *looking* for opportunities to get a run in (rather than using willpower to follow a pre-planned schedule) seems to work.

## 6. Boredom is good

Recently, I’ve been noticing & learning that purposefully letting myself be bored does wonders for my brain. I feel more peaceful, less anxious, and excited to pursue all my ideas and ambitions. When I’m bored and my mind wanders, it often lands on the things I truly care about — but only if my attentional hygiene has been good. Just like the last few points, look for opportunities to be bored. Don’t treat those moments as “RESIST INSTAGRAM AT ALL COSTS.” Willpower alone is not strong enough. Instead, revel in the feeling of discomfort. Just notice it, almost intellectually. That itself becomes a form of stimulation, but a much healthier one.
