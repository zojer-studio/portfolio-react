<TitleSection />

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about context-switching.

I first came across this idea a few years ago, when a co-worker ([Patrick](https://schaenzel.com/)!) recommended I set up “Focus Time” in my calendar. I was 21 at the time, and having trouble getting stuff done between all the meetings.

He observed that my calendar kind of looked like swiss cheese… I had meetings scattered haphazardly through the day, and very little room to work on a task uninterrupted. He explained:

> It’s important to “defend your time”. You’re not going to be able to get anything done if it’s constantly under attack. When someone schedules a meeting, they’ll take whichever empty spot is most convenient for them. You need to signal when/what is convenient for you, through your calendar.

In hindsight, pretty self-evident. But at the time, *revolutionary!* It clued me in on a major realization: every time I tried to get started on a task, I needed 10–15 minutes to switch gears. Or in other words, switch *contexts*.

Over the last 8 weeks, my team (in UW’s IxD program) has been conceptualizing new ways to think about calendars in mixed reality.

It started with the idea that calendars help you understand where you have to be, at a specific time. Pretty straightforward, right? The breakthrough was realizing, “where you have to be” isn’t just a physical location—it could also be your *headspace*.

We call it “**managing your position-in-time**”; in particular, we’re interested in a tool that helps you manage your *subconscious* position-in-time.

One of the key problems we’ve identified is that switching contexts is resource intensive. Not only does it take time to switch, but it can be *exhausting*. It’s the reason why we suck at multi-tasking (especially across very different contexts), and it’s a big reason why we procrastinate.

To illustrate this, (1) think about what it’s like to write a case study for your portfolio. It probably takes a while to re-collect your thoughts, remember all the details. The words don’t come naturally, and you reeeally have to *strain* to figure them out. (2) Contrast this with journaling. When you get into it (stream-of-consciousness style), the words just flow—automatically.

In the first example, the heavy lifting is done by your *conscious.* In the second, it’s your *subconscious.*

**Tangentially, I’m reminded of Peter Watts’s book, *[*Blindsight*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/48484)*, a SF novel which proposes the idea that consciousness is an extremely inefficient process—and possibly an evolutionary dead-end.**

More to the point, to really do something well (and even enjoy doing it), your subconscious needs to be aligned with it. (*There is a lot to unpack + elaborate on this claim, but I’ll leave it at this for now.)*

And, it presents a design opportunity: **how might we re-imagine the calendar to support more intentional context-switching?**

Last section, and the messiest one!

I wanted to highlight that the current (grid-based) calendar is an excellent tool **for events that have a defined start + end**. We call these “**blocks”** of time. For example: meetings, conferences, or even seeing a movie. In these situations, you plan to be in a specific position, at a specific time (usually to align with *other people’s* position-in-time).

And this system does the job! There’s a reason why so many people love the calendar. It establishes order in the chaos.

*What if blocks were represented by a gradient? Well, I think you’d lose out on the elegance of the current (grid-based) system. But could it be implemented in a different system?*

**But, so much of our lived experience doesn’t fit within the rigid bounds of a “block”.**
- Typically, a block does not account for the time it takes to mentally context-switch *before* the block. *(you’ll often see people create additional blocks as “focus/preparation time”)*
- Blocks are great at representing events, but not good at representing time spent working on tasks. *(we’ll call this “focus time”)*
- Focus time does not share the requirements of an event. A user doesn’t *need* to be in that specific position at that specific time; they’re not in sync with anyone else.
- Planning the length of focus time is very hard. *(yes, it is a learned skill to gauge storypoints, but the point is that the “block” does not support its inherent fluidity)*
- Planning a specific position is also unclear. It may depend on what has been completed, external parties, etc.
- Even during focus time, a user can’t really control our subconscious’s position. The most they can do is nudge it, and hope it aligns with the block. *(this is another learned skill)*


**Ultimately, there is an opportunity to explore a new system—one that takes this fluidity into account. What that shapes up to be? Well, that’s for another post :)**
