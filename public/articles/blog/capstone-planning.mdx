In the last quarter in UW’s design program, each student works on a capstone project (which could literally be [anything](https://www.uwdesignshow.com/project-list)).

## Project overview + goals

Generally, I'm interested in building a personal project management tool in XR. Something genuinely useful; and more pertinently, a way to explore gestural interactions.

Cycles — a mixed reality app exploring new forms of task management through gestural interactions, and a deeper understanding of how our brains actually work.
- Develop a working Unity app for Quest 3.
- Utilize Meta’s XR Interaction kit for gestural interaction.
- Explore the use of EEG & EMG sensor data.
- Submit to the [Meta Quest Presence Platform Hackathon](https://metaquesthackathon.devpost.com/) (Mar 24 — May 13).
- Launch and sell the app on Meta’s Quest store.

## Context

Throughout last quarter (Wi24), my teams and I explored ideas around time, task management, and context switching.
- **In DESIGN 483,** we re-envisioned the calendar by remodeling it after a clock. Users can create tasks/events and place them on a cyclical ring, which turns as time does.
- **In HCID 513,** we conceptualized an XR app which uses environmental cues and little decision-making prompts to help users switch context.


A big idea throughout both these projects was that of “position-in-time.” Rather than focusing on what you will *do* throughout the day, the goal was to start thinking about where your *headspace* is, and where it will be. (i.e., your subconscious position)

## Too many cooks

In 483, I felt we were on the verge of creating something really cool. We put a lot of thought into our work, made some pretty big breakthroughs… but to be frank, we were never able to execute as a team.

The problem we faced was having too many cooks in the kitchen. As we ideated, we relied heavily on our personal experiences, our own agendas. (Which makes sense, given that we were breaking new ground — and, that everyone has different & deeply personal ways of navigating their position-in-time.) But more to the point, this created a big problem for our team: in order to get anything done, we needed to spend a ton of time + energy making sure we were all on the same page. Each of us had to sacrifice our personal vision for the project, so that we could keep working together. It resulted in a very Frankensteined deliverable.

## Why solo?

To really *do* something, I think it is *necessary* for the team to be united behind a shared vision.

I’ve learned a lot from my time at UW. I’ve learned to think big picture, to communicate, and biggest of all, to let go of my ideas. In every single design class, my biggest takeaway has been a new insight about teamwork.

But, there are only [a few projects](https://www.davidschultz.co/work/arboretum) I can look back on, proudly. This is my last quarter in school. I’m coming into capstone with a clear vision of what I want to achieve, and I have the skillset to do so. I don’t want to spend all my time trying to align my ideas with others — I want to execute on them!

To be clear, this isn’t to say I’m opposed to working with other people! It would be great to get help with things like branding + marketing. And, there are a few designers in my cohort who I click with + would love to work with again. But, my impression is that they have their own visions they want to chase. If someone is to join my team, I want it to be because they believe in the same vision that I have.

Also, I won’t be alone! My partner from HCID 513 wants to continue working together (and I do too), which is excellent. She has a background in neural engineering, which overlaps nicely with AR/VR/XR applications. And, she’s on the same page about ideas re: context-switching.

## A design opportunity

I feel very strongly that there’s more to explore with “position-in-time”. Whenever I talk to people about it, it seems to resonate. They’ll bring it up a week later, sharing how often they noticed the impact of context-switching in their daily life. I think it speaks to the attentional overload my generation is experiencing.

Ultimately, there’s a design opportunity here — which, interestingly, coincides with recent advances in mixed reality technology.

Since December last year, Meta has been making [major updates](https://www.threads.net/@aiatmeta/post/C4wYBpQiMD4) to their Interaction SDK (software development kit). They’ve made it *really* easy to build experiences in XR. In particular, the geniuses over there have created a super intuitive system of “[Hand Pose Detection](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-hand-pose-detection/).” Basically, you stick the headset on your face, load up your dev environment, and hold your hand(s) in whatever pose you like. Then in Unity, you can take this pose and initiate interactions from it. It is seriously impressive stuff (and in my testing, works pretty consistently, too).

I’ve got my hands on a Quest 3, and have poured a ton of time into learning Unity. I built an (almost!!) working prototype for our calendar app last quarter, and have a pretty solid foundation now. I’ve also had my head in VS Code for quite a while now.

## Cycles

Regardless of where we ended up, our team did good work in 483. There is a whole catalog of ideas I wanted to pursue from our ideation. For capstone, we’re going to move away from trying to reinvent the wheel (i.e., the calendar), and hone in on task management. The big idea will still be to help people “manage their position-in-time” — but this time, the emphasis will be on the present moment (as opposed to planning the future).

I’m pretty intent on submitting to the Meta Quest Hackathon I mentioned earlier, which means we’ll be working with a tighter deadline than other groups. This happens to be a very good thing, as it means we can spend our energy in the last few weeks gearing up for the exhibition.

Additionally, my partner and I will be bringing the project to a conference/showcase her club (CoNECT) is hosting. And, we’re both interested in possibly submitting a publication from our work — however, this exceeds to scope of Spring Quarter, and will likely take form later on.
