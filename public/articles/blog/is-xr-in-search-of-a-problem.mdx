I’m very excited about the potential of this technology. I think it has a lot of potential to change how we go about our daily lives… but while there’s huge potential, there’s a lot of work to be done to realize it.

Common consensus is that XR is a solution in search of a problem. But I don’t think this is true. For one, a lot of experiences (rn) are confined to your pocket. That severs the connection between it and the world around you. A simple example is the timer on your phone, for a pot on the stove. There’s a pretty clear disconnect there, and XR addresses it by allowing digital experiences to occupy the same physical space as its relevant context.

But bigger than that, we’re three-dimensional creatures. We’ve evolved acute senses, and a wide range of motion to interact with the world. And unfortunately, a 2d screen hardly utilizes any of it. We sit there with our neck hunched over, and our eyes locked in place. Everyone knows this is an issue. And VR/MR/XR/whatever addresses it!

So I guess the most interesting thing to me about XR is that it opens up a whole new paradigm of interactivity. Gestural interaction in particular are super cool; I recently picked up this game, RumbleVR, where you play as an earthbender. It’s sick, and unlike anything else I’ve experienced.

Getting this tech up to speed for widespread adoption is no easy thing; for one, even with how good the hardware is now, it needs to improve dramatically for (A) comfort, and (B) face-to-face interaction. Additionally, the design patterns are still in their infancy. Somehow, we have to bridge the gap between precise input without precise controllers. But that’s the fun part, isn’t it?
