# Setting up MDX Blog Infrastructure

This post demonstrates the new blog infrastructure for your portfolio site.

## Features

The new blog system supports:

- **MDX files** with full component support
- **Frontmatter metadata** for titles, dates, and visibility
- **Automatic routing** via Next.js App Router
- **Table of contents** generation from headers
- **Consistent styling** with the existing work sections

## How it Works

### File Structure

Blog posts are stored in `/public/articles/blog/` as `.mdx` files. Each file needs frontmatter with:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
subtitle: Brief description
year: 2025
date: 2025-10-17
thumbnail: path/to/image.png
order: 1  # Optional: lower numbers appear first
visible: true  # Must be true to show in navigation
---
```

### Routing

The system automatically creates routes at `/blog/[slug]` where the slug matches the filename (without extension).

### Components

You can use React components directly in your MDX:

<div className="p-4 bg-bg-secondary rounded-md">
  <p className="text-tx-secondary italic">This is a custom styled component!</p>
</div>

## Next Steps

With this infrastructure in place, you can now:

1. Add new blog posts by creating `.mdx` files in `/public/articles/blog/`
2. Use React components within your posts
3. Control visibility and ordering via frontmatter
4. Enjoy automatic table of contents generation

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
